To install the Intune plugin, your app must be using Capacitor 3.2.0 or above. You must also have [an active Ionic Enterprise install key](https://ionic.io/docs/supported-plugins/setup) with access to Intune.

Once you have a key and your key has been associated with your app, install the main plugin package:

In your app, run:

```shell
npm install @ionic-enterprise/intune
```

Then follow the steps to finish the native installation and configuration for iOS and/or Android.
