## Why use Ionic's Intune support?

Microsoft Intune is a complex product, and integrating the native Intune App SDKs for iOS and Android is very challenging and time consuming. With Ionic's Intune support, developers can get up and running with Intune integration in their app with considerably less work and native development experience required.

Ionic's Intune support is practically drop-in ready for iOS and Android, with minimal native configuration required. The majority of the configuration required involves setting up the Azure AD and Intune policies in Azure that are unique to your organization.
